1. I looked up some of the rarest html elements and found some useful ones.

source: https://code.tutsplus.com/articles/10-rare-html-tags-you-really-should-know--net-3908

a.

<optgroup>

One looks like it could be helpful in creating a navigation bar with drop-box lists for my portfolio website (<optgroup>). It helps you to group options together.

b.

Another one is (<acronym>).

"The <acronym> tag is a way to define or further explain a group of words. When you hover over text that has the <acronym> tag used, a box appears below with the text from the title tag. For example:"

"The microblogging site <code><acronym title="Founded in 2006"></code> Twitter</acronym> has recently struggled with downtimes.

c.

Another is <ins> and <del>

which show markup for insertions and deletions, underlining the first and striking through the second. "John <del>likes</del> <ins>LOVES</ins> his new iPod."

d.

<abbr>

"The <abbr> tag is much akin to the <acronym> tag, except the <abbr> tag is only used to define shortened words. Just like <acronym>, you define a title within the tag. When a visitor hovers over the shortened text, the full definition appears below. The <abbr> tag is rarely used, but the benefits are many for screen readers, spellcheckers, and search engines.

"<abbr title="Sergeant">Sgt.</abbr> Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club is my favorite album."

e.

<wbr>

"The <wbr> tag is an incredibly obscure tag. To be honest, I doubt many of you have come into contact with the tag, as it's hardly ever used. (Truthfully, I hadn't seen the tag before I started researching this article.) Essentially, the tag allows you to specify a place where you think a line break might be useful, but only if needed. This tag is unique as it relies on the discretion of the browser to insert the line break, if needed. It's perfect for creating layouts that you want to avoid having horizontal scrollbars."

f.

<details>

definitely should use this for my portfolio website

makes text expandable, etc. will be very helpful.

g.

<meter> tag -- already use this for my website. Although I need to clean up my website and make the links interlock and then make it live on github.

h.

Although now I have learned about the <progress> bar, which is different?

"<progress value="750" max="1000">
  <span>70</span>%
</progress>"

i.

<q> for quote, working with <cite> looks really helpful for me as well.

<q>
The <q> element is used to identify quoted text on a web page. It is mainly used to show a brief quotation.

<q>Tests are stories we tell the next generation of programmers on a project.</q>
The <cite> attribute specifies the source of the quotation.

<p><cite>Roy Osherove</cite> said, <q>Tests are stories we tell the next generation of programmers on a project.</q>.</p>

j.

<base href="" target="_blank"> (self-closing tag)

"For relative links, the HTML base element is used to provide a base URL."

2a.

"If your quotation spans through multiple lines, you should use the <blockquote> tag."

2b.

oh wow, ruby tags; relevant to showing pronunciation of unicode, for example;

"The <ruby>, <rt>, and <rp> tags
"According to the MDN Web Docs

"The Ruby <ruby> HTML element represents small annotations that are rendered above, below, or next to base text, usually used for showing the pronunciation of East Asian characters. It can also be used for annotating other kinds of text, but this usage is less common.

"The HTML Ruby Fallback Parenthesis (<rp>) element is used to provide fall-back parentheses for browsers that do not support the display of ruby annotations using the <ruby> element.

"One <rp> element should enclose each of the opening and closing parentheses that wrap the <rt> element that contains the annotation's text.

"<ruby>
  明日 <rp>(</rp><rt>Ashita</rt><rp>)</rp>
</ruby>

    <ruby>Ayodele<rt>Surname</rt></ruby>
    <ruby>Samuel<rt>Middlename</rt></ruby>
    <ruby>Adebayo<rt>Lastname</rt></ruby>
