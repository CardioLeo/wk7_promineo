took a bit to listen and work on my linkedin post; now returning

<script src="demo..." defer></script>

"defer" above makes sure that the script only renders after the html has completely loaded; seems like if you make the src= and external source that also makes it render later?

<form> </form>
encapsulates multiple elements together

<input type=""></input>

<button></button>

---

requirements for week 7 project:

-at least 3 pages
-links to navigate between all pages present on each page (can be identical?)
-A list
-3 images
-2 different size headers
-a table
-a form

SEMANTIC HTML

I really need to learn more about these.

The only nonsemantic tags:
<div>
<span>

"Most tags are semantic nowadays."

semantic ones:
footer, header, nav, form, article, main, section


only one <header> and only one <main>

you might have multiple <article> tags.

<nav><ul>
<li>Home</li>
<li>About</li>
<li>Contact</li>
</ul></nav>

src="#sample" links to a tag below with the id tag id="sample"

good to know.

class ended at 8pm today since it is about html and that's pretty easy; he said to try to work on previous week's project (week 6 capstone -- still unfinished by me). Good idea. I also want to revamp and activate my own website so anyone can pull it up.
