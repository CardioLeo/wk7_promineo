Star Method Research Notes

What does STAR stand for?
Situation
Task
Action
Results

First source: https://www.caseinterview.com/star-method

In other words, the Star method is a way of concrete narrative training, a way to learn how to give good oral presentatons (oral culture, oral histories). [What is the phenomenological genealogy of professional interview questions viewed as oral histories and presentations of self?]

1. Situation
"What was the situation you / your previous employer faced?"
2. Task
"What tasks were involved in that situation?"
3. Action
"What actions did you take?"
4. Results
"What were the results of those actions?"

"...get to the heart of what a candidate //actually// did in a previous work experience."

interviewers hate the word "WE" and they want to hear not merely a summary of what was done total, but of what actions you yourself did

benefits both interviewer and interviewee - can highlight faster what matters

two candidates - a and b, a has done x in actuality, which is small, b has done wxyz in actuality. Star method brings this out.

"The only downside of the STAR method is: if you’re trying to “fake” your accomplishments and stretch the truth (beyond merely casting your experiences in a favorable light), it will be very hard to hide one’s exaggerations using the STAR method.

"Of course, this downside for the secretly weak candidate is an upside for the strong candidate."

Seems pretty apt. I always feel like I've done nothing though - and so in a way I have to make sure I remember (and write down so I don't forget) my actual actions and achievements, which are notable, as shown by my recent new website, which does show off a number of achievements. Lucinda said that it was incorrect to say that they were "meagre accomplishments." I need to learn how to talk about those for real.

[source ends by suggesting the PARADE method, which they say is much stronger, though harder to remember - now I want to check that out...]

That is all for first source

Second source: https://novoresume.com/career-blog/star-interview-questions

star behavioral interview questions are probably number 1 in difficulty for most people. hum. [compared to technical questions? I guess that's apples and oranges, right?]

"Behavioral questions always require you to tell a story of how you faced a specific situation at work, and how you dealt with it."

STAR method and behavioral questions are **narrative questions**, questions requesting a narrative to be formed and expressed. (Never tell me that English is a worthless degree - the reality is just that we hide the value by giving names in other fields uninteresting scientific names like "behavioral questions" and "STAR method").


"Questions like:

"So, tell me about a time when you handled conflict well.
"What is your greatest achievement?"

S - situation and context, explain what they need to know quickly but clearly - relevantly

T - roles, duties, what was expected of you?

A - carry out tasks, fulfill roles, or do more than expected?

R - "This is the conclusion of your answer and story. Explain what results your actions had and if the situation was solved successfully or not. The use of numbers and data is a bonus."

Here are the top 7 of the 19 STAR behavioral questions from second source, which I really definitely should come back to and flesh out with some real life examples to help me remember.

"The most common questions are:


1.
"Tell me about a time when you were faced with a challenging situation. How did you solve it?

2.
"Do you usually set goals at work? If yes, could you give me an example of a goal you had and how you achieved it?

3.
"Give me an example of a time you made a mistake at work.

4.
"Have you ever faced conflict with a coworker? How did you resolve the situation?

5.
"Tell me about a time when you handled the pressure well.

6.
"Was there a time when you had to be very strategic in order to meet a goal?

7.
"Give me an example of a situation when you showed initiative and took charge of a situation."

I'm not sure I need a third source. I think I need to move on. Although part of me wants to make my own STAR infographic..... distractions, distractions... [maybe later]

---

an image online says:

S - Set the Scene
T - Describe the Purpose
A - Explain what you did
R - Share the Outcome

---

Okay, that's definitely enough research. Class starts in 10 minutes. Geez, that took way too much time...
